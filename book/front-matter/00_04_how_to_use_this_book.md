[00-START-HERE](../00-START-HERE.md) · [01-READING-ROUTES](../01-READING-ROUTES.md) · [00\_03\_preface](00_03_preface.md) · [00\_05\_for\_interview\_candidates](00_05_for_interview_candidates.md)
This unit explains how to choose a reading route, use the book’s recurring section structure, interpret its interview tags and references, and turn its appendices into preparation tools.
## TL;DR
- Choose among interview preparation, reference use and systematic study.
- The dependency order and five role paths are study recommendations; experienced readers can revisit prerequisites as needed.
- The source contents contain 247 numbered main-chapter subsections. Its recurring template names seven elements despite calling them six moves; this guide uses the corrected seven-element count.
- The one-week sequence is deliberately incomplete, not a certification of readiness or a deployment checklist.
- Cross-cutting connections are useful, but analogies such as projection and self-reinforcement must not replace their mathematical assumptions.
- Timed drills and two-week formula-recall goals are practice heuristics, not empirically validated thresholds for competence.
## The story
Think of the book as a rail network. Part I is the central station. It gives every traveler the shared vocabulary and the five-decision map needed to understand later signs. A first-time traveler stays on the full line because each part depends on stops that came before it.
A traveler with a specific destination chooses one of five ordered service lines. One line serves retrieval and ranking quality. Another serves vector search infrastructure. Three more reach product delivery, trust and safety, and advanced training. The stops on each line are ordered, so skipping ahead can leave the traveler without the connection that makes the next stop useful.
The one-week path is the express train. It starts with the answer skeleton and failure attribution, then stops only at the listed core chapters and timed drills. It deliberately passes the rest of the network. The tradeoff is explicit: a partial map that supports reasoning is better than a complete map produced by skimming.
Six cross-cutting threads act like transfer stations. The recurring section format is the signage inside every station. The three difficulty tags identify what kind of ticket an interview answer must carry. The appendices are the station toolkit, with formulas, self-tests, checklists, reporting templates, readings, notation, and terminology.

## Core mechanics
### Opening use model


| Lens | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| What | Choose among interview preparation, on-the-job reference, and systematic study. Read linearly from scratch or follow a targeted route for a role or gap. |
| Why | The choice aligns the amount and order of reading with the reader’s goal. |
| Failure without it | A reader can skim too broadly or enter a later topic without the vocabulary it assumes. |
| Stated cost or tradeoff | Linear reading covers dependencies but takes the full route. Targeted reading narrows the route but must still preserve its stated order. |


### Linear Reading Order
The part order follows suggested conceptual prerequisites. It is not a theorem that all prior parts are needed for every later question; use the dependency table to find missing background.


| Part | Topic | Prerequisite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I | The RAG interview landscape | None |
| II | The generator side | None |
| III | Prompting and context construction | Part II |
| IV | Representing what you retrieve | Part II |
| V | Indexing and vector search | Part IV |
| VI | Retrieval and ranking | Parts IV and V |
| VII | Query understanding and control flow | Parts II and VI |
| VIII | Training the RAG system | Parts II and VI |
| IX | Generation and context assembly | Parts II, III, and VI |
| X | Evaluation | Parts VI and IX |
| XI | Trust, credibility, and adversarial robustness | Parts VI, IX, and X |
| XII | Scaling, advanced variants, and design drills | All prior parts |




| Lens | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| What | Follow the part dependencies from the RAG landscape through scaling and design drills. |
| Why | Later parts assume earlier vocabulary and concepts. Part I uniquely supplies the shared parametric, non-parametric, and semi-parametric vocabulary plus the five-decision skeleton. |
| Failure without it | Later material can appear disconnected because the reader lacks the terms and organizing skeleton the writing assumes. |
| Study trade-off | Part I is the recommended shared start; other prerequisites depend on knowledge gaps and the specific task. |


### Targeted Reading Paths
Every path is ordered rather than ranked. Read the selected path from top to bottom. Each starts at or near Chapter 3 because the later material hangs on the five decisions.
#### Path 1: Retrieval and Ranking Quality
Use this path for search-relevance and applied-science roles where the interview asks why the right document is not at rank 1.
1. Chapter 3, including Section $`3.4`$ for sizing before design.
2. Chapter 12 on sparse versus dense retrieval and sentence-embedding contents.
3. Chapter 13 on chunking, granularity, and whether semantic chunking pays in Section $`13.6`$.
4. Chapter 18 on BM25, saturation, and length normalization.
5. Chapter 20 on bi-encoders, DPR, and hard negatives.
6. Chapter 21 on SPLADE, ColBERT, and hybrid fusion with RRF.
7. Chapter 22 on reranking, cross-encoders, and rerank depth.
8. Chapter 24 on query reformulation and HyDE.

10. Section $`41.4`$, the multi-hop question-answering drill.
#### Path 2: Vector Search and Platform Infrastructure
Use this path for roles that own index capacity, recall targets, latency budgets, and the on-call pager.
1. Chapter 3, Section $`3.4`$, on sizing before design.
2. Chapter 15 on HNSW’s skip-list analogy, IVF, and the recall, latency, and memory tradeoff.
3. Chapter 16 on product quantization and end-to-end index-memory arithmetic.
4. Chapter 17 on tombstones, sharding, metadata, and over-filtering risk.
5. Chapter 37 on latency placement, KV-cache reuse, and cost per query.
6. Chapter 38 on federated search, source selection, and data residency.
7. Section $`41.1`$, sizing 100 million documents at 500 QPS from first principles.
8. Section $`41.2`$, a system that must stay fresh.
#### Path 3: Shipping a RAG Product
Use this path for applied-AI and product-engineering roles where the interview covers the whole loop and failures users encounter.
1. Chapters 1 and 3 on what is tested and the answer skeleton.
2. Chapter 4 on hallucination taxonomy and five causes of factual error.
3. Chapter 9 on RAG prompting and Section $`9.4`$ on why retrieving more can cause more hallucination.
4. Chapter 11 on abstention and calibration.
5. Chapter 13 on chunking and granularity.
6. Chapter 25 on when to retrieve, where to retrieve, and adaptive routing.
7. Chapter 30 on lost in the middle and why a longer window need not fix it.
8. Chapter 31 on attribution and citation.
9. Chapters 33 and 34 on generation evaluation and stage-level regression attribution.
10. Section $`41.6`$, debugging a RAG system that became worse.
#### Path 4: High-Stakes, Trust, and Safety
Use this path for regulated domains and for questions about a retrieved document that is wrong or hostile.
1. Chapter 4 on what the model brings and what it breaks.
2. Chapter 5 on privacy, copyright, and SILO’s addressable revocation boundary, without treating a datastore as legal immunity.
3. Chapter 11 on when the system should refuse and how each abstention mechanism fails.
4. Chapter 31 on attribution as the core promise of RAG and the difference between claim support and proof of actual model use.
5. Chapter 35 on source credibility, one bad document among many good ones, and pluralism.
6. Chapter 36 on provenance, indirect prompt injection, and datastore poisoning.
7. Section $`41.3`$, high-stakes RAG in medicine and law.
8. Section $`41.7`$, retrofitting credibility onto an already shipped pipeline.
#### Path 5: Training the System and Advanced Variants
Use this path for research-oriented roles where the interview moves beyond assembling components and asks how to change them.
1. Chapters 6 and 7 on retrieval versus parameters and the in-context-learning mechanism.
2. Chapter 8 on circuits, induction heads, and the limits of interpretability claims.
3. Chapter 27 on generator fine-tuning, RAFT, and robustness to retrieval defects.
4. Chapter 28 on the four quadrants, FiD, REPLUG, and LM-supervised retrieval.
5. Chapter 29 on bootstrapping data and the limits of treating teacher quality as a strict student ceiling.
6. Chapter 23 on generative retrieval’s evidence-access, update and cost trade-offs.
7. Chapter 26 on iterative, recursive, and agentic retrieval, including RL for search.
8. Chapters 39 and 40 on multimodal RAG and graph RAG.


| Lens | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| What | Select one of five role-focused routes and keep its listed order. |
| Why | The paths concentrate preparation around the kind of judgment a role is likely to test. |
| Failure without it | Treating a path as a ranked menu can remove the setup needed by later stops. |
| Study trade-off | The route omits other topics; keep dependencies in mind, but adapt to prior knowledge and role-critical gaps. |


### The One-Week Path
1. Read Chapter 3 first for the answer skeleton.
2. Read Chapter 34 second for attributing a failure to a stage.
3. Read Chapters 1, 15, 18, 22, 25, 30, and 32 in that order.
4. Work Sections $`41.1`$ and $`41.6`$ as timed drills.
5. Skip everything else.


| Lens | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| What | Use the source’s express sequence when the interview is next week. |
| Why | It prioritizes an answer frame, a debugging frame, core mechanisms, metrics, and two design drills. |
| Failure without it | Broad skimming can produce a complete-looking map that the candidate cannot reason from. |
| Stated cost or tradeoff | The route is intentionally partial. The source prefers a partial map that supports reasoning over a complete map built by skimming. |


### The Cross-Cutting Threads
Follow cross-references to the main treatment of an idea, but distinguish analogy from identity. Robustness is not universally an exact orthogonal projection, and inference-time self-reinforcement is not the same process as recursive synthetic-data training collapse.


| Thread | Introduced | Recurs in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adaptivity, one size does not fit all | $`3.5`$ | $`13.3`$, 25.1-25.6, $`26.4`$, $`35.6`$, $`39.4`$ |
| Robustness as projection | $`27.3`$ | $`5.4`$, $`7.4`$, $`11.3`$, $`20.3`$, $`39.2`$ |
| Collapse and self-reinforcement | $`11.3`$ | $`26.6`$, $`29.7`$, $`34.6`$, $`35.4`$; distinguish inference feedback from recursive training |
| OOD fragility of learned controllers | $`25.7`$ | $`26.5`$, $`34.1`$, $`35.6`$, $`38.3`$ |
| Lost in the middle or positional bias | $`30.1`$ | $`22.5`$, $`30.6`$, $`39.9`$, $`40.7`$ |
| Query \<-\> document as surrogates | $`29.1`$ | $`21.1`$, $`23.4`$, $`24.6`$, $`32.1`$ |




| Lens | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| What | Follow the introducing section whenever a later section names a thread without explaining it. |
| Why | The design avoids repeating full explanations and exposes connections across separately learned topics. |
| Failure without it | A reader can mistake a cross-reference for an unsupported claim or miss the shared idea that links chapters. |
| Stated cost or tradeoff | The reader must move back to the introducing section. The benefit is less repetition and stronger conceptual connection. These six ideas are especially likely to earn interview follow-ups. |


### Conventions in Every Section
The source contents enumerate 247 numbered main-chapter subsections. The described teaching template has seven named elements, not six: motivation, concept/derivation, figure, worked example, practical decisions, interview framing and takeaways. The source’s six-move label is a counting inconsistency. The table describes an intended template, not an audit proving uniform layout in every revised section.


| Named element | What it contains | Why it exists | Failure without active use | Stated cost or requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Motivation | Two paragraphs about who asks, production cost, and why the obvious answer is insufficient | Places the reader in the room | The reader can know a term without knowing when or why it matters | It explicitly includes the production cost of getting the issue wrong |
| Concept and derivation | First-principles construction, symbol definitions, units, one italicized claim, and the defeated alternative | Teaches both mechanism and judgment | A choice without its losing alternative teaches nothing about judgment | Carry units through arithmetic and retain exactly one memory claim |
| A figure | At least one pipeline, index structure, ranking funnel, decision tree, or comparison table | Makes structure visible and printable in grayscale | A color-dependent or content-only rendering can hide the intended takeaway | Vary shape and line style rather than hue. The caption states the takeaway |
| A Worked Example | A numeric end-to-end instance with real configurations and orders of magnitude | Converts an idea into memory, latency, cost, or recall arithmetic | Passive reading is the single most common way to finish a chapter having learned nothing | Use a calculator and end with a sanity check against a published figure or known system |
| What You Actually Decide in Practice | Four to six decisions with defaults and triggers to deviate | Bridges discussion and shipping judgment | The reader can discuss a technique without being able to choose a default or departure condition | It is the part the source calls most directly useful on the job |
| How This Shows Up in Interviews | Three increasingly difficult questions with strong-answer shape | Trains ordering, derivation, and follow-up handling without supplying a recitation script | The candidate can memorize text without learning answer structure | At least one question explicitly contrasts a strong and weak answer |
| Key Takeaways | Four to six standalone lines, including at least one worked-example number | Preserves the chapter argument in compressed form | Skimming cannot recover the argument or its quantitative anchor | At least one line must carry a number from the worked example |


### Difficulty Tags
The tags describe what a question tests, not how hard it is to read.


| Tag | What it tests | Strong-answer shape | Failure consequence or weakness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[core]` | Knowledge of the mechanism | Explain the mechanism directly | Failing one can end a phone screen for someone who claims RAG on a resume |
| `[senior]` | Ability to derive | Produce a number from a stated memory budget, latency budget, or recall target | A memorized number does not satisfy the tag |
| `[staff]` | Judgment under a changed constraint or a dispute between partly correct teams | Price options, concede the other side’s real point, choose, and state the reversal condition | Taking a side without pricing or a reversal condition misses the judgment test |


### Typography and Cross-References


| Lens | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| What | Interview questions use italics inside quotation marks. Notes and remarks appear sparingly in boxes. Sources appear by author and year at the point where each claim is made. The book collects them in Appendix E. Cross-references point to specific sections when possible. |
| Why | The typography separates practice questions and caveats, while precise references route the reader to the actual derivation. |
| Failure without it | A reader can confuse a caveat with a dependency or search through an entire chapter for one derivation. |
| Stated cost or tradeoff | Boxes are reserved for misconceptions, version caveats, and edge cases. They never hold material required by the main argument. |


### Using the Appendices


| Appendix | What | Why | Failure without it | Stated cost or trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | Formulas for BM25, RRF, MRR, nDCG, modularity, PQ sizing, FLOPs, and index memory | Supports active derivation work | Re-reading formulas can replace the derivation practice the book expects | Keep the formula sheet nearby. After roughly two weeks, practice re-derivation; timing is a heuristic, not a competence cutoff. |
| B | Question bank organized by difficulty with answers held separately | Enables genuine self-testing | Chapter questions reveal the strong answer directly below the prompt | Use it when testing what is actually known |
| C | Design checklists for retrieval, indexing, evaluation, credibility, and latency | Makes system checks reproducible | A candidate can omit a critical design dimension | Reproduce the retrieval checklist verbally in under two minutes |
| D | RAG card and index datasheet templates | Supplies reporting standards for a shipped system and a handoff answer | The next team may not know what the system does | Use the templates for systems actually shipped |
| E | Annotated reading list keyed to chapters | Collects prose attributions | Source follow-up becomes harder | Follow chapter keys to the attributed reading |
| F | Notation table in reference form | Centralizes symbols | Repeated symbol lookup interrupts derivation | Use it as a reference |
| G | Glossary | Reconciles a field where one idea can travel under four names | Terminology can make equivalent ideas look different | Use it when names differ |


## Diagrams
The manifest lists zero figures and zero tables for this unit. There are no manifest captions to reproduce or normalize.
The source pages contain two unnumbered reference matrices. The part-dependency matrix and the cross-cutting-thread matrix are preserved as Markdown tables in Core mechanics. They are not manifest figures or tables.
## Whiteboard pack
### What to draw
1. Draw one central box labeled `Part I: vocabulary + five decisions`.
2. From it, draw a full dependency line labeled `Linear route`.
3. Add five ordered branches labeled `Retrieval`, `Infrastructure`, `Product`, `Trust`, and `Advanced variants`.
4. Add a short express branch labeled `One-week path: 3 -> 34 -> 1 -> 15 -> 18 -> 22 -> 25 -> 30 -> 32 -> 41.1 + 41.6`.
5. Mark six transfer circles for the cross-cutting threads.
6. Draw one repeated station card for the named section elements, then place the three difficulty tags and Appendices A through G beside it.
### Spoken script
Start at Part I, the central station, because it supplies the shared vocabulary and five-decision skeleton. From there, choose the full dependency line or one of five ordered role paths. If the interview is next week, take the express route through Chapters 3 and 34, then the listed core chapters and two timed drills. Mark six transfer points for the cross-cutting threads. Inside every stop, expect the same recurring section pattern, then use core, senior, and staff tags to judge the question. Finish with the appendices for formulas, self-testing, checklists, reporting templates, readings, notation, and terminology.
## Interview traps
### 1. Are all twelve parts mandatory before targeted preparation?
Part I is the recommended common starting point because it introduces vocabulary and the design skeleton. A reader who already knows those concepts can use targeted routes and return to prerequisites; “mandatory” is a study recommendation, not a logical requirement.
### 2. Can I treat a targeted path as a ranked list and pick only the highest items?
No. The source says each path is ordered, not ranked. Read it from top to bottom because later stops depend on the setup provided earlier in the route.
### 3. What should I do if the interview is next week?
Use the stated express sequence: Chapters 3 and 34, then 1, 15, 18, 22, 25, 30 and 32, followed by drills $`41.1`$ and $`41.6`$. Omitted topics remain relevant when a role or deployment requires them; do not interpret “skip everything else” as safety, legal or operational clearance.
### 4. Do `[core]`, `[senior]`, and `[staff]` mean easy, medium, and hard reading?
No. The tags test mechanism knowledge for core, derivation from stated constraints for senior, and priced judgment under a changed constraint or disagreement for staff. They identify capability rather than reading difficulty.
### 5. Should Appendix A become a permanent formula crutch?
Use Appendix A while actively deriving. After roughly two weeks, test unaided derivations and revisit weak spots; the timing is a practice suggestion, not a requirement to discard a useful reference or evidence that continued reference use signals incompetence.
